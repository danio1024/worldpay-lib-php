### PHP 5.2
PHP 5.2 and below do not support extended exceptions. The library will return a standard exception in these versions. This means you will need to change the try catch, to catch on 'Exception' instead of 'WorldpayException'. The methods 'getHttpStatusCode', 'getCustomCode' and 'getDescription' will also not be available.  

If you are using the examples, you will need to edit them, please see the in file comments referencing PHP 5.2.
